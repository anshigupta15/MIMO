# Introduction

Challenges for existing Cellular Networks - 
a) Peak downlink data rate in LTE is 150Mbps. 
b) Can support approximately 37 users at HD rate(4Mbps).
c) LTE networks can support around 100-1000 users per cell.
d) Latency in 4G networks is around 30-50ms. Hence they cannot support applications such as autonomous vehicles and drone communication.

Hence, new application requires a massive increase in aggregate data rates. 

5G targets enhanced mobile broadband(eMBB) with ultra high data rates around 10Gbps.
5G is expected to connect 10s of 1000s of devices (1 million devices per square meter) through Enhanced Machine Type Communication(eMTC) 
5G allows ultra-reliable low latency communication(<1ms) (URLLC).
